WOO Publications
================

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law `Wet open overheid (Woo)`_ was established, 
requiring government organisations to actively and digitally publish their documents and thus create *public records*.

To support govenment organisations in executing this law, the "Generic Publications Platform Woo (GPP-Woo)" was developed. 
This platform is an aggregation of four components, including the 'WOO Publications' component. 
This component provides a storage repository and JSON API to manage and expose public records including their metadata.

For a full publication platform, three additional components are required:

* WOO Administration (`GitHub <https://github.com/GeneriekPublicatiePlatformWoo/Openbaar-Documenten-Publicatie-Component>`_), a component which provides public servants with a web-based user interface to manulaly upload and publish public records.
* WOO Search (`GitHub <https://github.com/GeneriekPublicatiePlatformWoo/search>`_), a component responsible for indexing public records.
* WOO Citizen Portal (`GitHub <https://github.com/GeneriekPublicatiePlatformWoo/Openbaar-Documenten-Burger-Portaal>`_), a component which provides citizens with a website where they can browse and search through public records.

All components are designed in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.
